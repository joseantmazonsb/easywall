# What is this

This a fork of [easywall's project](https://github.com/jpylypiw/easywall/) which contains a [branch that can be used to dockerize the original app](https://github.com/joseantmazonsb/easywall/tree/docker), so you can use it inside a container.

## Install

The installation process is pretty straightforward, and you will only need to follow the steps provided [here](https://github.com/joseantmazonsb/easywall/blob/master/docs/DOCKER.md). Of course, you will need to edit the `docker-compose` file to better fit your own scenario. For a more detailed explanation of that file's options, please head to the [docker branch's readme](https://github.com/joseantmazonsb/easywall/blob/docker/README.md).
