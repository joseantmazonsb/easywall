# Guide

## Dockerfile

This container is based on the official [python's docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/python) `python:3.9-buster`.

All dependencies are installed at build time, and all source files are copied to `INSTALL_PATH`. Nonetheless, the `docker-entrypoint.sh` script still does a thing or two depending of whether it is the first run or not. If it's the first time, it will run the `install-core.sh` and `install-web.sh` files, which will set up, among other things, the HTTPS or HTTP server, depending of the presence/absence of the SSL files required to deploy a HTTPS server.

## Docker compose

The `docker-compose.yml` file is pretty self explanatory and includes some useful comments. However, the following table aims to clarify some aspects about the options chosen to run the container:

| Option | Explanation |
|-|-|
| `network_mode: host` | In order to apply the iptables rules inside the host, we need to run the container using this network mode. |
| `NET_ADMIN` | Capability needed to interact with the network stack. |
| `NET_RAW` | Capability needed to perform operations related to network packages at kernel level. |

# Expected behaviour

The container will load all rules from the file `rules.yml` when it is started, albeit it saves the previous rules to restore them once it is **gracefully** stopped (*planned*). Furthermore, **the container won't start at boot time by default**, so unless the `restart` option is modified inside the `docker-compose.yml` file, the rules will not be enabled after the host machine is rebooted.

You will be able to see the firewall rules from the host via `iptables -L`, although you can also use `docker exec <container_name> <command>` to execute all sort of commands inside the container.

# Known issues

- **All** docker rules are currently flushed when easywall applies its rules. This **may** affect your docker networks.
- Running other containers **will** affect your iptables rules, since docker will automatically add rules when starting a container.
