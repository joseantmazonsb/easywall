# How to *dockerize* Easywall

Until an official image is uploaded to Docker Hub, here's how to run Easywall inside a docker container:

1. Checkout the `docker` branch:
    ```
    git clone --single-branch --branch docker https://github.com/joseantmazonsb/easywall.git
    ```
2. Use `docker-compose` to build and run the container:
    ```
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

## Security concerns

The docker approach lets you choose whether to start the web server with SSL features enabled or not.

### Running a HTTPS server inside the container

By default, the container will only run a HTTPS server if a SSL certificate and key are provided within the `docker-compose.yaml` file. You will need to mount both files as volumes the first time you run `docker-compose up` if you want a HTTPS server deployed by default. However, if you don't, you still can switch to HTTPS directly from the web GUI, via `Options -> Webinterface`.

The SSL files must be placed inside the container under `/ssl`, and the certficate must be named `easywall.crt`, while the private key must be named `easywall.key`.

### Reverse proxy

If you already have a main web server running in another machine with SSL features enabled, and you would like to reuse it, then the reverse proxy's approach is your best option.

To set up a secure reverse proxy using Apache2 you will only need to create a configuration file for the virtual host as follows:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:443>
	ServerName easywall.example.com
	ServerAlias easywall.example.com
	ServerAdmin hostmaster@example.com

	ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
	CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

	ProxyPreserveHost On
	ProxyPass / http://10.0.0.99:12227/
	ProxyPassReverse / http://10.0.0.99:12227/

	SSLEngine on
	SSLCertificateFile /certs/fullchain
	SSLCertificateKeyFile /certs/privkey
</VirtualHost>
```

And, of course, you will need to edit this template to fit your own scenario.

## Logging

By default, Easywall logs to `/var/log/easywall.log` inside the container. So, you could create a log file and mount it as a volume pointing to `/var/log/easywall.log`, and you would then be able to access Easywall's logs directly from the host.

Moreover, you may also call `docker logs <container_name>` to check the logs from the current execution.

## Known issues

### I switched from HTTPS to HTTP and I can no longer log in

This is a cookie 'issue'. You will need to remove all easywall cookies from your browser and it should be working as expected again.
